#### ⚙️ **How New Games Are Added (Very Simple)**

Only 2–4 lines needed to add a new game:

1. Create `games/<game-id>/index.html`  
2. Add icon to `assets/icons/`
3. Add this to `games.js`:
```js
{
  id: "game-id",
  name: "Game Name",
  icon: "assets/icons/game-id.png",
  url: "games/game-id/index.html",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "popular"]
}
```

#### 🖥️ **Pages Overview**

**1. `index.html` (Homepage)**
- Shows only "popular" games (filtered by tag)
- Search bar at top
- Sidebar on left (scrollable list of all games)

**2. `all-games.html`**
- Shows every game (same layout as homepage)
- Uses same search + sidebar components

**3. `games/<game-id>/index.html`**
- Fullscreen embedded game
- Opens when you click a game from the grid

---

#### 🔍 **Search Functionality**
- Live filtering using JavaScript
- Search by name or tags
- Search bar in top nav of all pages

---

#### 🤖 **Recommendation Logic**
- Based on localStorage
- Track recently played/viewed games
- Show similar games (based on tags)

---

#### 🎨 **Styling (in `assets/styles.css`)**
- Game cards in responsive grid
- Sidebar scrollable with fixed width
- Dark mode sidebar, light mode main section
- Mobile responsive layout

---

#### 🚀 **Deploying to GitHub Pages**
1. Push your code to GitHub repo
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**
3. Set source to `main` branch, root folder
4. Live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

---

#### 🧪 **Optional Features (Nice to Have)**
- Favorites/bookmarks via localStorage
- Game rating system
- Category filters in sidebar (tags)
- Random game button
- Leaderboard / high scores with external storage
